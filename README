NAME
    lib::if::dev - Use lib/ if we're in a dev root

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of lib::if::dev - released
    September 08, 2012 as part of lib-if-dev.

SYNOPSIS
        # does a 'use lib "lib/"' if exists Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or dist.ini
        use lib::if::dev;

DESCRIPTION
    If you're running a script from your development root (or anything else
    for that matter), it's often fun to figure out how to include lib/ in
    your command both so that you don't need to remember to do a "-Ilib" or
    have to remember to remove 'use lib "lib"' statements before releasing.

    This package aims to solve that (for one value of "solve").

    If your current directory contains a directory "lib" and one or more of
    Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or dist.ini, then this package pushes 'lib/' onto
    @INC.
